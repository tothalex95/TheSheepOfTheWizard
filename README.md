# The Sheep Of The Wizard

Hildrath, the great wizard has a flock of sheep. These sheep
are of a quite calm type, they do not wander all about the place
like normal sheep do, they just stay where they are, each at
a given point on the plane. Nevertheless the sheep have to be
watched. Until now, the wizard looked after them himself, as he
was pleased to count them again and again and enjoyed seeing
how rich he was.
But now, he kind of got bored of counting sheep. He decided
to use his magic powers to turn one of his sheep into a shepherd. Your task is to choose
the right sheep for him, unless you want to make him mad, and be turned into a sheep –
or something much worse – yourself. Given the coordinates of the sheep, you have to find
one that if turned into shepherd can watch all the others with the least eye movement.
That is, find the one sheep from which the rest of the flock is seen in the smallest angle.
